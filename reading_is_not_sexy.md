# Neither Reading Nor Glasses are Sexy, But That Won't Stop You From Fantasizing

Reading is not sexy *per se*.
Of course, anyone capable of reading the slogan would presumably consider illiteracy to be undesirable, and reading to be a sign or signal of good qualities.
Finding illiteracy undesirable, however, is not the same as being sexually attracted to reading.

I'm sure people find "reading", as a trait, attractive, not in a sexual way but in an affiliative, friendly one.
It has been well established that people like others who are similar to them, who share traits or identities with them.
The shop selling this graphic says, "Bookworms are HOT!"
So, in addition to appealing to a vague affiliative feeling borne of loosely-defined similarities, this is explicitly reinforcing and signaling the bookworm identity.
Obviously, bookworms are not, as a group, hot, but there is something here beyond mere ingroup-signaling and wishful speaking, something genuinely sexual (or perhaps romantic).

First, a difficulty to overcome, to do with the overly reductionist way in which many people describe their own sexuality.
While someone might say they like "wide hips" or "big shoulders", what really matters for most is the visual contrast with the rest of the body, that is, the WHR or SHR.
In this case, "wide hips" are a sort of metonym for that aspect of the physique formed by the waist, hips, and legs.
The waist and legs are left out of the explicit description, but to really understand what it's all about, we have to fill them in.
Some may understand this metonymy explicitly or implicitly, but many simply do not know what they are talking about.
This is not a problem we can really get to the bottom of, but one that must be resolved by reconstructing, in words, those crucial components that had been left out of the explicit verbal description.
Hips and shoulders have already been covered. What about glasses?

I first want to note that many profess that "glasses are sexy", a statement analogous to "reading is sexy".
This is implicit in such constructions as ubiquitous and low-class as the listicle title "Girls with glasses are so sexy (25 pics)".

Glasses often serve as a metonym, sign, or signal, but I want to leave this aside now and consider the pair of eyeglasses as a perceptual phenomenon and real object.
Glasses, and other ornaments like nose rings or necklaces, draw our attention, drag it around, and provide contrast and focus.
Let's return to the "reading is sexy" design from the beginning.
The frame of the glasses accentuates and draws attention to points of attraction: her confident gaze, and her beautiful eyes.
We can easily imagine another common fantasy scenario - manicured fingers deftly place glasses over her downcast eyes, which snap up to catch yours, as her fingertips slowly, gently trace a path back down smooth cheeks.
Now, imagine the same cheek, pocked with a yellow-greening, angry infection.
Glasses aren't sexy, cheeks are.
We can repeat the same exercise with the "temple tip on lip" pose, which is also commonly replicated with a pencil or pen.
Neither pens nor glasses are sexy, lips are.
Pencils are not "IT", but if you have it, you can use a pencil to draw attention to it.

Speaking generally now, an ornament has a enhancing and distorting effect on the traits it highlights.
If the thing it draws attention to is beautiful, the experience of perception is made more beautiful.
Glasses are less of a static ornament, like a piece of glittering jewelry is, but are better described as props.
All the fantasy scenarios previously discussed have some element of motion or implied action (even if that is just fixing you in her gaze).
An ornament could adorn a static figure of beauty, such as a statue, but the term "prop" implies agency and motion (even if they are only implied, e.g. the woman's gaze in "reading is sexy").
I have, hopefully, already established that glasses can serve fantastically as a prop
What about something a bit more dull, like a book?

In order to realize a book's potential as a prop, we have to break through the surface-level sensual fantasy, with its perceptual dynamics, and fully submerse ourselves in a robust fantasy world, and its dynamics of situated longing.

Imagine the man of your desires.
You've been reading Shakespeare together.
You're discussing it together in front of a fire he has made for you.
Wrapped in his quiet, warm strength, he stares, almost in awe, into your eyes and softly remarks, "I never thought about King Lear that way before".
You feel seen, known, loved.

Nobody fantasizes about an ugly, unkempt man turning to them, eyes dull with disease, and stammering out "I n-never thought about Richard th- Richard the Third that way, um, ah before, you're p-pretty smart for, I mean, for a girl."

The book is a prop.
I'm sure if reading is important to you, many of your fantasies will incorporate books or reading.
You may have even been seduced in a bookshop.
However, Mr. Right is not handsome because he reads any more than Nicki Minaj is beautiful because of her wigs.

Reading is of romantic consequence, of course.
It opens up worlds of possibilities, settings and opportunities to love and be loved, as would any shared interest.
Perhaps it makes sense to say that dance, or reading, or fishing is romantic.
It's still not sexy. Girls with glasses are not, with apologies to listicle writers, so sexy.
To books, and to glasses and nose rings will be ascribed what a beautiful person can make of them.

In a nutshell: "17 hot girls wearing glasses" is the proper construction.
