# The triune brain metaphor as an example of broader problems in pop neuroscience

### *Q:* What to use instead of the idea of the triune brain or "lizard brain / limbic system/ primate neocortex" model?

### *A:* Gut, heart, and head ;) (see the first link on triune brain)

I think it actually makes a lot of sense to distinguish between direct somatosensory sensations (a twist in your gut, elevated heart rate), emotions (sadness, fear) and thoughts (fuck, that bear is eating our sloppy joes). However, we don't have to and indeed shouldn't localize them to lizard/limbic/primate brain. For a more accurate neuroscientific basis for some kind of sensation/emotion/thought framework, I personally recommend Lisa Feldman Barrett. There is a ton of movement and controversy in cognitive neuroscience and particularly in the subfield of emotion science, but the triune brain theory has clear problems. It's completely inaccurate.

Rather than describe or try to summarize the scientific inaccuracies, or problems between the theory and the facts. If you're interested in that, check the citations at the bottom. Instead, I will elaborate on why I dislike the theory as it relates to other theories and ideas.

Firstly, the "lizard brain" conceptualizes one's inner lizard as an entity separate from the speaker. This aligns with this inaccurate idea a lot of people have of mind-body dualism: that the mind and the body are "distinct and separable". In particular, it also represents a broader trend in psychology: that of partitioning the mind into independent entities. While there is well-documented functional separation throughout both the human body and the brain, everything is connected, often more so and in more complicated ways than many would think. The brain, in particular, is hard to break up in the way that the body itself can be broken up into organs, or organs like the kidneys can be further broken up into functional substructures. This is to say, while the brain and mind have some degree of modularity, structure/function relationships are particularly obscure in the brain.

Most importantly, my problems with the triune brain concept are representative of problems I have with much of pop cognitive neuroscience -- the brain is not a machine in the way it is often described. These descriptions can obscure more coherent psychological descriptions of the mind, and more accurate mechanistic descriptions of the brain. When it comes to the theories themselves, they can be to some degree accurate, but deeply misleading, such as analogizing the brain to a computer. At their worst, these can feel like claims that avocados are good for your balls because they look like testes, or walnuts are good for your brain because they look like little brains. That is, the interpretation of structure is spurious\*, and its relationship to the proposed functional relationship is not established. The facts and interpretations may be valid, but their described or implied relationship is not. 

Some of the appeals to neuroscience you see in daily life are so bad that they are not theories, but rather disjointed flailings in the direction of scientific legitimacy. Shallow or flatly wrong versions of neuroscientific theories are often used in a way that could be characterized as bro-science or cargo cult science. Claims that sound scientific are sprinkled on top of a fairly non-related work in order to add an air of scientific legitimacy or depth. The claims themselves may be true or false, but they often involve references to well-known scientific theories or concepts, often with a puzzling level of specificity that is disjointed in comparison to the broader text. This occurs in texts that range from scholarly works that are rigorous in other respects, on down to ads for substanceless scams. Quantum physics is often invoked for the scammy kind of authority-by-association attempts, perhaps because most people regard quantum mechanics as so complicated and mysterious that they could never really understand them. As the saying goes, it is sufficiently-advanced science indistinguishable from magic. 

All that being said, the idea that there is a tiny and very emotional lizard trapped inside of you is pretty great aesthetically. To me, a big part of the human challenge is figuring out how to cultivate our capabilities and self-awareness. This may involve techniques that feel silly, or whose mechanism of action we don't understand. If I can pretend I'm a little robot with a printer and some ticker tape, and it helps me figure out how to do computer science problems, then that's great (as long as I recognize I am not actually a little robot). If you try imagining a gambling demon or persona within you that you have to battle with to stop gambling, and it helps you quit , why let scientism get in the way of success? If there are two wolves physically inside you, and one is gay, and the other is also gay and fucking the first wolf over a pool table while the gambling demon watches, smoking a cigar, and the good little robot keeps counting his ticker tape off in the corner, oblivious, and that's just really fucking hot, and is in fact the only thing you can get off to after months of quarantine -- do you. Bringing it back, there's some clear utility to have different ways of understanding your being, even if they're goofy. So, there is still some value, I think, in the idea of the lizard brain, just as a fun metaphor or weird mental trick rather than a scientific theory.

\* spurious reasoning:

Either non-mechanistic entirely, or mechanistic in a way that is not actually relevant to the proposed functional mechanism.
Another error of this type is treating tenuous interpretations as natural types. Something can plausibly be construed as Y, even though Y is a reach. Just because X __can__ be interpreted as Y, does not mean that Y is the best interpretation, or that it is on the right level of analysis or in the right conceptual framework. That's somewhat tangentially related to the noncentral fallacy AKA "The worst argument in the world".

some examples:
- jordan peterson thinks that ancient art depicts DNA, which is just bizarre (https://debunkingdenialism.com/2018/06/25/jordan-peterson-ancient-art-depicts-dna/)
- youtube video -- "The brain has two hemispheres because the world is made of Chaos & Order - Jordan Peterson"
His contention is that we should view the world as somehow divided between Chaos and Order, and to reinforce the claim, he says that the brain has two hemispheres, one that deals with chaos and another with order. If you had to characterize one side of the brain as the "chaotic" and the other as the "orderly" one, you could. There are documented asymmetries in the brain. However, "chaotic hemisphere" and "orderly hemisphere" are not natural types. I may be out of my depth here, but if I had to characterize what most clearly separates the function of the left from the right, I would say that it's side-specific processing of auditory and visual stimulus, as well as motor planning. That is to say, the right processes visual signals from the left visual field, while the right processes signals from the right visual field, and so on. There's actually a symmetry there, despite the side-specificity. Additionally, wholly cognitively functional humans exist with only one hemisphere, and they're not solely capable of dealing with either Chaos or Order, depending on which hemisphere was excised. The fact that you CAN construe some facts about the hemispheres in light of your conceptual framework, does not mean that the nature of the hemispheres themselves constitute any evidence for the validity of your claim.
