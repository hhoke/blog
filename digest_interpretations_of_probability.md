## Partitioning Uncertainty
Part of the uncertainty expressed by any wager or probability is uncertainty that is due to a system's inherent tendencies, and part is uncertainty surrounding unknown factors such as an incorrect model. 
For example, if we flip a coin and assume it is fair, we have a 50% chance of landing heads, which follows naturally from the fact that the coin can only land heads or tails.
This is Aleatoric uncertainty.
However, we cannot always be sure that a coin we are presented with is fair. 
This is where Epistemic uncertainty comes in.
I found this approach refreshing, as I usually just hear about the bayesian/frequentist distinction.
These, and other, kinds of uncertainty are laid out more clearly in [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification).

## Brier Score: Probabilities of Probabilities

In brief, if it rains 80% of the time a forecasting method predicts rain, that forecasting method is an accurate one, and the more the actual number deviates from 80%, the worse the method is.

## Appendix: Probability and Chaos
I made some connections between the coin-flip scenario and attractor dynamics, due to a recent encounter with Strogatz. No doubt these are not original, but if they were new to me they may be new to some readers.
Consider the following scenarios:

- you flip a coin
- you pick a coin out of a box without looking at it, and place it on a table

Most people would agree these are probabilistically equivalent.
Now, take a more abstract scenario:

- you and your friend pick a number at random out of the interval [1,0]. If they are on the same side of 0.5, you win
- you and your friend pick either 1 or 0. If they are the same number, you win.

What is happening in the case where we flip a coin is that uncertainty arises out of the attractor dynamics in the chaotic system of a coin falling on the ground. 
This coin has an unstable fixed point (the side), and two stable fixed points (either face).
The sensitivity to initial conditions is what creates the uncertainty here.
