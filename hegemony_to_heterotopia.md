HBO provides, via microwave, the first original cable television production of The
Pennsylvania Polka Festival from the Agriculture Arena in Allentown to customers of John
Walson's Service Electric, a cable system in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

(from Britannica)
"Furthermore, after Bing Crosby began prerecording his Philco Radio Time show in October 1946, other programs followed suit; instead of being aired live, more and more programs were transcribed. As a result, prime-time radio soon lost much of its immediacy. When programs went out live, the listener knew that an announcer could make a “blooper” (say an unintended or forbidden word), an actor might miss a cue, a sound effect might not work—anything could happen. With the onset of transcribed shows, the listener knew that little unseemly would happen, because all the mistakes had been edited out. Thus, radio became less spontaneous and less exciting.

"it's foolish to think of EDM as a genre, because as Eric demonstrates using five very different and longer-lasting musical areas, it is instead a format. You go to a festival like Electric Zoo in New York, or TomorrowWorld in Atlanta, and you get X amount of progressive house plus X amount of deep house plus X amount of trance — ad absurdum. It's no different than programming a radio station, because a formula is calibrated and then tweaked in more-or-less real time, or at least as often as the books allow. With festivals it's a lot of wheeling and dealing — and a lot more names than on a typical radio playlist, even one as wide as Top 40 at its broadest. Format is precisely right."
AMAZING. really interesting viewpoint.

"The ongoing primacy of Top 40 resists the myth of internet-fostered "long tail" undergrounds succeeding."

basic facts: radio 83% by 1940
FM took over in the 70

how did formats get developed? How do they relate to Cable TV?

"Bundling scores of networks together has endured in large part because the programmers and distributors both made huge profits from new channels, rising numbers of subscribers and steadily higher cable bills. Plus, until recently, it would have been a logistical nightmare for distributors to sell channels individually."

"
At the time, the idea of selling channels individually didn’t enter the equation. Tailoring packages of channels to customers was technologically challenging, and the costs and management of billing were seen as prohibitive.

“The history of the pay-TV bundle is the history of a forced private subsidization imposed upon the American public by America’s largest programmers,” said Jimmy Schaeffler, chairman of the Carmel Group, an industry consulting firm.

"Second, by way of explaining why most cable services leave much to be desired, is that the U.S. cable infrastructure was built because tax laws made it a nice way of making lots of money, not because anyone actually cared about television."
"
The second lesson we can draw from this book has to do with the place of content as a force and source of revenue on the Internet. Look at how the cable industry grew: In the very beginning, it was about giving people in rural areas access to some TV, as opposed to none at all. Similarly, during cable's nationwide expansion, it was about getting connected -- getting access. The carriers, not the programmers, had the upper hand. Only after cable access became commonplace and cable channels developed brand identities did content achieve primacy in the eyes of consumers. TCI's history with ESPN is a very concrete illustration of this point. By the late 1980s, people took their cable hookups for granted, but they wanted their MTV.

Development of Drive-time radio?

"
Plenty of broadcast stations and cable systems have made deals without the benefit of bitter ad campaigns. Many agreements do not involve direct payments, but the creation of new cable channels to be run by broadcast networks and carried by the cable systems.
 
ABC, for example, has reached a deal with several of the nation's largest cable operators, including Time Warner Cable, that will let the operators carry ABC's eight owned-and-operated stations, including WABC in New York. The systems will receive the ABC stations' programming without cost. In return, ABC, a majority owner of ESPN, will be able to show a new cable channel, ESPN2, and receive a per-subscriber fee.
 
The Fox Broadcasting network, which is planning a new cable channel with an unspecified format, reached similar deals with several major cable operators, including Tele-Communications Inc. And last week, NBC said it signed a deal with Time Warner that covers its six owned-and-operated stations, including WNBC in New York, and involves creating a new all-talk cable channel. CBS, which does not own a cable channel, has been unable to make any cash deals with major cable systems."

in an age when many restaurants are introducing low-calorie alternatives, why would Taco Bell dip its popular Gordita, a stuffed pita concoction, into a deep fry to create a higher-calorie and higher-fat version, the Chalupa? Advertisements for the Chalupa never say this, but its creation was "aimed at increasing transactions with our core heavy fast-food users," according to a recent Tricon International quarterly-earnings press release.

"People may talk healthy, but they don't buy healthy," said Thomas H. Strenk, managing editor of Restaurant Business magazine. "When they go out to a restaurant, they want to splurge."

Many fast-food places do have light items like salads and yogurt, but these are included to round out the menu and prevent customers from automatically ruling out the restaurant because its food is too heavy.

# The Center Will Not Hold: the mass medium lifecycle and the victory of Format

## Globalist Homogenization

A lot of right-wingers have this conspiracist idea that The Globalists\* are purposefully manipulating the media to homogenize tastes, wipe out local subcultures and traditions.
You can hear this narrative on Tucker Carlson all the time.
This phenomenon undoubtedly occurs to some extent.
However, it is not due to a centrally-planned plot, but rather emerges from the interactions of individual actors, each reacting to market forces.
Similarly, consolidation is only half of the story.
To get the full thing, we will need to review some fascinating dynamics that cut across different media technologies.

(There are a lot of fascinating stories I only allude to below.
Think of the below as partly essay and partly a guided tour through the bibliography.)

## Ecological Succession in a Mass Medium

As a mass medium is developed, it starts out as a wild west, before becoming established--homogeneous and homogenizing, finally following a predictable pattern of brand diversification driven by the construction of ever-more-refined submarkets, or capitalization of existing audience groups.
The printing press, if my limited knowledge serves me, was first used to create Bibles in Latin, as had been read to the people by priests for centuries, before the great diversification of printed word that accompanied, and in some ways constituted, the Protestant reformation.
Even more interesting was the evolution of programming schedules, brands, and market segments for TV and radio, which evolved in astonishingly similar ways.

### Broadcast Monoculture to Narrowcast Format

For a certain period, our right-wing conspiracist is right: mass media such as syndicated radio and TV was a monoculture.
However, this peaked for radio in the early 60s, and for TV in the late 80s. 

It used to be that one radio station would play soaps in the day, news at dinner, and music in the evening (often, a middle-of-the-road variety show format) [Golden Age, GSO].
Radio stations were limited, but were the only broadcasting technology available.
By the 70s, home listening through records [LP] and the development of FM radio stations and the concept of the music format led to targeting of particular market segments, particular audiences [Origin of Format].
A fascinating side-effect of this shift, together with the white migration into the suburbs and away from cultural centers such as dance halls, led to the modern phenomenon of white people, particularly men, being unable to dance for shit [I Don't Dance].
At the same time, with the introduction of TV, the old radio format of soaps, news, primetime dramas and evening variety had become the new TV format with few alterations [80s TV wasteland].

Things used to be very middle of the road with the big three networks from their establishment in the late 40s and the days of TV/Radio simulcasts through the 80s.
However, by then, the boring landscape was ripe for exploitation by something new and differentiated.
Just as the 80s were closing out, FOX used extensive market research to launch an outsider network with then-edgy shows like The Simpsons.
After that came cable. 
The explosion of channels facilitated a similar transformation as had happened in radio's Format revolution.

A cable saturation graph follows a roughly sigmoid growth curve, with the explosive growth phase squarely situated in the 80s, directly following a series of federal court cases. [80s Cable Explosion, HBO vs. FCC]

\* I personally find it somewhat endearing that many on the far-right have begun to use the preferred term of their leftist counterparts, "neoliberalism". The word is so overused by leftists that I will use Ctrl+F to scan sociology/anthropology papers for a "neoliberalism" count before reading them, as a rough negative indicator of quality. We are not only living through neoliberal hegemony, but a growing adjectival hegemony of "neoliberalism" in letters.

\*\* a personally-saddening consequence of the Trump era is seeing many open-minded, highly-educated people in my social circle slowly devolving into conspiracy-minded, media-junkie troglodytes that lack even the old-timey charm of senile Fox News addicts 

[Golden Age] "The variety program, a combination of comedy and music that almost always included a singing host and a guest star for the week, also dominated the period. Frequently, a comedy sketch would be included among the proceedings. The earliest examples of the form often featured a popular dance orchestra. For example, The Goodrich Silvertown Orchestra, named after its sponsor’s tires, was an hour-long program for NBC from 1926 to 1928" https://www.britannica.com/topic/radio/Variety-shows
[GSO] " Thursday nights at 10pm ET" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goodrich_Silvertown_Orchestra
[83%] "In 1930, more than 40 percent of American households owned a radio. A decade later that number more than doubled, to 83 percent. Live musical performance dominated the airwaves in the early years. Dramas, comedy acts, talk and educational programs soon followed."

[LP] "rock'n'roll, like its antecedents, was an ever-changing ragbag of black and white styles, but the Beatles, by leading rock away from its black roots and from the dancefloor towards a more European art music, split popular music along racial lines." https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/22/beatles-destroyed-rocknroll-elijah-wald

[I Don't Dance] " As all this was happening in the fifties and sixties, white people, black people, and latino people all started listening to different music. Black and latino people continued to listen to dance music and to think that it was acceptable for both genders to dance. In fact, when white people moved to the suburbs and stopped going to those big ballrooms to dance, they turned into salsa clubs. Then radio stations also started to separate and niche-guard — before that everyone listened to a lot of the same music, but that ended. So you have all these radio stations and some of it is clearly dance music and some of it’s not. You have mostly white men listening to music that’s not and dance occasions become this increasingly awkward thing you get drunk or stoned to do.

[Origin of Format] "When television added the visual component, audiences naturally preferred to see the entertainers. Radio simply could not compete with television as a medium for entertainment aimed at mass audiences... changing radio from a mass medium to one that served a specific audience... By the end of the 1950s network radio amounted to almost nothing but hourly national news, some sports, and special events such as presidential speeches and national elections. Radio had become truly a local medium controlled by individual stations, and the stations had come to see clearly that their future lay not in the broadcasting of entertainment to a mass audience, but in the transmission of information and music to particular segments of the total audience in a particular community." https://www1.udel.edu/nero/Radio/readings/development.html

[80s Sitcom Wasteland] "Most American industries, everything from oil and airplanes to cars and computers, began with a vast collection of wildcat operators, a few of whom eventually became big, established companies. Movies and radio started much the same way. In their early years, anyone could get into the business and the hand of censorship was light to nonexistent.

Television never had that freewheeling infancy. From the time it became widely available in the 1950s and right up to today, television has always been the product of established companies with existing rules and regulations. The radio networks, decades old and amply stocked with coiffed men in tailored suits, simply took their buttoned down broadcasting philosophy and applied it to the new medium. For its first three decades, the culture of television was staid and unchanging.

Through thirty years of social changes and technical improvements, the three networks pumped out fare that was mostly remarkable for its consistency. Certain types of shows would become trendy or fall out of favor, hemlines went up and down, and new stars would emerge and fade, but the airwaves were always dominated by action, mystery and detective shows, soap operas, variety hours, and the ubiquitous family comedies. By the mid-1980s, American television was beginning to transition from the stuffy, centralized and highly censored world of three networks to the hundreds of channels that exist today, but it hadn’t happened yet. A person from 1955 could switch on a television in 1985 and be instantly at home. Even some of the same players were still around. Andy Griffith, star of Simpsons punching bag Matlock, had debuted on television during the Eisenhower Administration and was still one of its biggest stars under Reagan.

[HBO vs. FCC] "The federal district court in Washington, D.C., that heard the case of HBO v. FCC issued its decision in 1977. It ruled that the FCC was not justified in restricting cable TV in order to protect the broadcast networks. Following this first ruling, a whole series of court decisions overturned other FCC restrictions on cable TV. Cable operators gained the right to air current movies and sporting events, for instance, and to offer services in the nation's top television markets. The rulings also freed the cable industry from FCC requirements to provide local communities with special channels to air their own programming." https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/rise-cable-television

[Hate, Inc] "As a business, the news media was headed this way long before Trump. However, we’ve now arrived at a place where the Good morning, everybody model geared toward delivering information broadly has been switched out for a model that, more than ever, works backwards, beginning with the audience. It’s more like demographic targeting, or audience-framing, than information delivery." Hate, Inc. by Matt Taibbi
