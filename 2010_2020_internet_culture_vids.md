## Best Internet Culture Vids **RARE**BITS**

I few months back, I created a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMhB6YQV6_R9P0IoZ6ggi98GbBe4gPt8). I just made copies of all videos on the playlist, in case they are deleted, and thought I would post here. Description below.

The first three videos are must-watch and blew my mind. The next few describe important parts of internet commerce and get-rich-quick schemes. Everything from there down is of varying quality, but was added for coverage of youtube, tumblr, and 4chan. I'm going to start off with channel-level descriptions and move to video-level for the channels that are less good or that I am less familiar with.
 
HealthyGamerGG -- professional gaming addiction psychiatrist. Worth exploring the channel.
 
Charisma on Command -- His entire channel is clickbait, but he hit it out of the park with his simp video. It NAILS the description of how dopamine hooks actually work in social media. Note the use of the term "dopamine hooks" rather than the much more common "dopamine hit" which is EVERYWHERE and is WRONG. Dopamine is not Heroin or an opiate, and is thought to be more associated with reward anticipation and motivation than reward per se (though it is complicated) 
If you want more primary-source interviews on this topic, I would watch [The Lonely Fans of OnlyFans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djMojvschs0).
 
Nerd City -- Extensive and well-produced videos of an innovative journalistic style I call Hyper-Gonzo. He specializes in a form of investigative journalism in which he not only does inserts himself in the story, but actively takes part in the internet phenomena he describes, as in the "Try Hards" series or his youtube rating and monetization investigations. This channel is a passion project after he made his money off of HowToBasic. If you found the Jake Paul investigation compelling, check out "Youtube's Biggest Lie" and the LeLe Pons. "WORST MOM ON YOUTUBE" is a journey through softcore porn / breastfeeding youtube and the deeper network of paysites this serves as a funnel for. The "Prince Ea" videos describe a particularly toxic Inspiration Porn influencer, and are themselves good examples of "youtube drama" videos.
 
James Jani -- Slick and comprehensive videos that describe some other internet phenomena with a focus on Hustle Culture, gurus, and other scams.
 
Sarah Z -- Insanely articulate insiders' look at a lot of tumblr and fandom culture. The one downside for me is that she has politics typical of tumblr, so every once in a while you will hear an extremely handwavey criticism of capitalism. Her video on Bad Media Criticism is also outstanding.
 
Coffeezilla - more vlog/reaction vid style, lower-production value vids, but he hates gurus and has a decent backlog of primary source material.
 
Internet Historian -- His best video by far is The Engoodening of No Man's Sky, which is one of the funniest videos on youtube. Other vids are hit or miss, but HWNDU and Iphone Trolls describe important parts of 4chan history and were included for coverage of 4chan.
 
Philion -- the best commentary channel on the subject of the Internet Fitness industry. His videos on Alpha schlock, and Bilzerian are worth watching. His videos and commentary are generally high quality, but much of it is negative reaction videos rather than in-depth investigative work and is not always objective and rigorous. A lot of his better points about gurus are worthwhile but covered better by James Jani. His video "This Channel Is Exploiting Homeless People and Lying Their Way to Fame" covers bottom-of-the-barrel "prank" youtube channels.
 
(video) warner music claimed my video for defending their copyright in a lawsuit they lost the copyright for -- absolutely insane and kafkaesque journey into the roiling ball of corporate rat fuckery that is youtube copyright claims.
                                                                                                                                        
(video) The Heartbreaking Story Of Jessi Slaughter -- included for coverage of online bullying in the late aughts and early teens, the era of Encyclopedia Dramatica and Lulzcows, that era's kiwifarms. This vid seems competent, but no idea about the rest of the channel. If you're looking for more on living meme weirdos, Down the Rabbit Hole has more coverage of [Timecube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7lWCqbgQnU), [TempleOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCgoxQCf5Jg), and [WingsOfRedemption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHbm7GBHwg) (who are notable for being strange, not for being bullied).
 
STRANGE Ã†ONS -- tumblr on tumblr and other niche internet shit like Ben Shapiro's sister, mostly reaction videos. Commentary is insightful, but I'm not familiar enough with the channel to say more. Lots of good primary source material, and recreates a late-teens experience of talking with your Tumblr friend about all the weird shit they found last night.

(video) EXPOSED: Model Poses That Deceive You On Instagram -- IDGAF about the channel. This was added as an apertif / chaser for the  Nerd City series on instagram booty models. 
                                 
(video) Leftbook Was a Mistake. Added for Leftbook coverage. Hard to find vids on this topic, so coverage is thin.

Whang! -- added on friend rec and for reddit and project chanology coverage
