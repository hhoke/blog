I love you, ballerina bangs, you silly little fringe.

A fig leaf for traction alopecia. Doesn't sound fun. Ballerina bangs!

You've pulled your hair so, so tight for decades and that high-strung beauty has begun to corrode its own foundation.

You really didn't have to, but you did it all for me, after all, though you might not never admit it.

How can I be anything but grateful!

This, too. for me, to veil me from looking at your hairline and seeing my own death staring back.

Severely gorgeous, ballet bangs, I love you!
