# Confessions of a Research Technologist

To clarify, this is NOT about direct customer support, or working in a call center.
That is a whole different ballgame.
This is about embedded IT groups that service the core technology that keeps the broader organization running.

I have spent the last five years or so as professional couples therapist / child of the divorced parents that are IT and the rest of the organization. I have seen both remarkably functional and remarkably dysfunctional interactions between IT people and researchers.

I learned a lot about how people from these different groups, with different skillsets, norms, and goals, can work together more productively. Especially at my last job, the Harvard NRG, we had a lot of norms which really helped to keep things functional.

I want to sum these things up and write them down while the memories are still (mostly) fresh. Here I'll try to articulate some of the NRG's best principles, with illustrative examples. 

(All example scenarios are purely fictional, and any resemblance to any other scenarios, real or imaginary, is purely coincidental.)

## if you don't fix it, it isn't fixed / if the customer is wrong, tell them

IT is as much about talking with people as it is about fixing computers. It's very much about relationship management, even if it may not appear to be at first. This is a big problem for IT. Unfortunately, if you were lonely enough in high school to get good at computers, you're probably a kind of a freak. Relationships are not your thing, computers are. 

One of the consequences of this awkwardness is that a lot of internal customers end up dissatisfied with their IT group, despite the fact that the IT group has a lot of talented computer people in it. It's easy to find reasons not to provide service in IT -- your customers are usually less competent around technology than you are, or you would be out of a job. On top of this, IT is often overloaded. Many customers will not do basic things like read documentation unless forced to, or may have unrealistic expectations about what technology can do. Just as it is easy for IT to blame the customer, it is easy for the customer to blame IT. Customers often have misconceptions about how technology works, or moral failings such as pride or sloth. They are often wrong. However, in a relationship, you are not responsible for being right(morally or factually), you are responsible for a positive outcome for everyone. Resist the temptation to simply blame your counterparty for incompetence due to frustration or sheer laziness.

This mindset of communicating clearly, no matter what, is usually difficult, but worthwhile, and keeps the relationships that drive IT's value functional.

### Dysfunctional example: missing files
 
>**Customer Joe**: Hello [(nb: never do this)](https://www.nohello.com)
>
>**IT Bob**: Hello, Joe, what is your problem?
>
>**C**: I'm not seeing the files that were supposed to be uploaded to the linux cluster! We've been unable to do our research for a week! This is ridiculous.
>
>**IT**: OK, what should the files look like, and where are they supposed to be?
>
>**C**: They should be at /ncf/JoeLab/fMRI bay 2/2019

At this point, IT Bob checks the directory given, and finds that not only is the directory given nonexistent, but that the parent directory `/ncf/JoeLab` doesn't even exist. IT Bob is frustrated, just doesn't reply, and moves on to other things.

#### IT Bob's mistakes and how to do better

This is not a morality play. God is not going to descend from the heavens and judge you the Reasonable And Smart One, and condemn your client to IT hell. (no matter how much they may deserve it). Most importantly, you will not be able to evade the bad perception of your IT group forever. Customer Joe may not even understand that IT blames him for the issue. As far as he is concerned, IT is terrible and didn't do their job. As far as IT is concerned, Customer Joe is completely unreasonable and incompetent. Even if IT Bob is right, Customer Joe is also still right. How can this be so?

It is IT's job to enable the customer to use technology to further the broader organization's mission. If fundamental business operations are blocked, and IT has abandoned the problem, they have failed. I'm not saying the customer is always right. In fact, in IT the customer is usually wrong. That's what we're here for.

It is categorically better to explain to the customer why they are wrong, and continue to work with them on their problem, than it is to ignore them. Sometimes the customer will make this emotionally difficult for you to do. Do it anyway -- it's your job. In this case, it is especially clear that this is a problem of some priority, and is therefore particularly inexcusable to just drop the thread of communication. 

## Customer Joe's mistakes and how to do better

It is much, MUCH better to admit ignorance than give incorrect specific information. Customers often feel a need to prove their technical chops to the IT person for a variety of emotional reasons I won't go into here. Other customers may (rightly) think that the more computery they speak, the easier it will be for IT to understand them. However, incorrect details can mislead and frustrate the IT person. I have personally taken to using spanish-style punctuation to denote parts of a sentence I am especially unsure about:

> I'm seeing nothing in `df` and I think Â¿the disk isn't even mounted?

There are a lot of excellent [guides to asking good questions](https://github.com/selfteaching/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/master/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way.md). If you're working in a technical field, I highly recommend giving them a read.

### Functional example: missing files

>**Customer Joe**: I'm not seeing the .dcm files from 2019 that were supposed to be uploaded to the cluster. This is URGENT as it is completely blocking our work. I used filezilla to look in our lab's folder, which I think is supposed to be /ncf/JoeLab, but don't see anything!
>
>**IT Bob**: I see the problem. The files were sent to `/ncf/Joelab_archive`. Can you see that?
>
>**C**: I can't
>
>**IT**: OK, I changed the group permissions for that folder. Hopefully you can see them now.
>
>**C**: Great, thanks!
> **ticket has been closed**

### Theory of Mind: the importance of Empathy

Ultimately, "if the customer is wrong, tell them" is just a specific rule. In general, the broader principle is to work on your cognitive empathy. 

For example, imagine the inverse of the scenario above, where IT has "fixed" the problem by spouting some obscure string of commands that the customer does not understand. In that scenario, it is vital that the customer explain what they do not understand, and allow the IT person to provide needed context or further information.

Here are some other brief examples of where taking the time to appreciate your counterparty's frame of reference can reduce frustration and make the relationship more functional:

#### To IT workers:
- You know where the docs are. You have sent out links to the docs twelve times this week. Everyone in IT knows where the docs are. Everyone in IT doesn't even need the docs because they already understand your systems so well. The new research assistant is still not going to know where the docs are. Bear this in mind.
- The customer probably doesn't care how many gigahertz the new chip has. To them, Amber Lake might as well be that girl they went to middle school with that was obsessed with horses. Please refrain from spending  all your time with a customer talking about chip architectures, especially if the customer has been unable to complete work for weeks due to technical problems. It feels like going to the doctors and getting stuck listening to him walk you through his pokemon collection.

#### To IT customers:
- IT does not know how long you have been debugging your problem.
- No amount of cajoling, blackmail, or kowtowing will enable your IT person to fix a problem you have not described in sufficient detail. They are probably not refusing to fix it because they dislike you. They probably dislike you because you want them to FIX IT!!! without telling them what "IT" is.

### Addendum: Managers, stay in your lane

This is related, but I couldn't find a nice place to put it.

Managers (correctly) understand that their complaints will be taken more seriously. However, they frequently garble important technical details given to them by underlings in their escalation emails.  If you're a manager (yes, professors, you are managers), Make sure you are CC'd on chains, or forward emails where they need to go, but leave the details to the detail people if at all possible.
 
## deliver then develop, don't wait to deliver until you've developed 
It is natural, as a technologist, to want to improve things. However, often simple tasks can be put off because the Next Solution is right around the corner. This is a delicate balancing act that can be seen as the other half of taking time to [sharpen the saw](https://www.livingontherealworld.org/habit-7-sharpen-the-saw/)
