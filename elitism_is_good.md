A friend was dismayed that Yayoi Kusama had become so popular.
She loved that experience, back when it was tucked away in the corner of some gallery, waiting for a playmate.
Imagine what fun it was to discover!
It was a delight to be scattered by the mirrors, cast past the view horizon, and to dwell among contemplating reflections in long moments.

I was confused, I asked if the art had changed, I asked if it was merely the association with the iPolloi that was distasteful.
"No," she replied, "it's a different experience entirely."
The experience now is of the line, the hour-long line, being crammed into the box, using the art as a glorified IG filter, being yanked out before you can say goodbye.


One wonders what Mrs. Kusama makes of all this.
She is hardly to blame.
The machine of digital reproduction is but a wave for us mortals to ride.
If she refused to cooperate, someone else would take her place and the mirror-box would continue to proliferate, long human lines would still form, the pics would still be poasted.
Healthier for sure to surf the wave, make some money for a nice big house, than to be driven mad like poor [jani lane](https://www.metalsucks.net/2013/06/26/shes-hes-my-cherry-pie-jani-lanes-curse/).

I am a (delighted) foreigner only, in the land of visual arts; music is my native medium.
It is easy to understand my friend's distress in a more familiar setting.
The same song is changed utterly when it is sung face-to-face in a cafe, rather than prerecorded from the speakers, pumped past the blinding stage lights at a mass in which you are a molecule.
Everyone understands this, the appeal of Buckley's "phantom solo tour" is obvious for all involved.
There is a horror, even, of blowing up, of a beloved song going [viral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWO4JnP2T40&ab_channel=OurHitParade).
It is like being haunted by the ghost of a lover.
You will never feel each other again, there will be no more communion, but something that looks uncannily like their face, a hyperreal death mask, follows you around, is inescapable.

We live in a paint-by-numbers world.
Dance by numbers, total percentage 96.4572.
No encounter, only control and copying and the score, living by and for the screen.
We poorly play out this game of digital reproduction.
Matrix multiplication, binary transmission, leave it to computers!
Man and woman make much poorer copiers than Xerox.
Contra the bio-copiers, poor shambling passionless puppets with NO DICK (terrified even), life is generative, life invades the external and blossoms into it.
A score to sing richly aloud, a partner to thrill, a painting to confront and explore! 
A new land to make one's own.
That is living.

To cast a veil of reverent silence about that quixotic woman tilting at Anselm Kiefer, to clear space for that communion, I would sweep out the door uncountable biocopiers.
In an enlightened future, they also would not be deprived of their fun.
Photos would be generated automatically, of them appearing to look in the direction of appropriately popular paintings, and posted without effort, sparing them the bother of pretending to live.
