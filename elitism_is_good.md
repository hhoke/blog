A friend was dismayed that Yayoi Kusama had become so popular.
She loved that experience, back when it was tucked away in the corner of some gallery, waiting for a playmate.
Imagine what fun it was to discover!
A delight to be scattered by the mirrors, to have one's image cast past recognition.
To dwell among contemplating reflections in long moments.
She hated those installations now.
Fucking Instagram.

I was confused. I asked if the art had changed, I asked if it was merely the association with the iPolloi that was distasteful.
"No, " she replied, "the installation itself is the same, but now that it's popular, it's a different experience entirely."
The experience, now, is of the line.

- [ ] Hour-long line.
- [ ] Cram into box.
- [ ] Use art as IG filter.

Sad!

One wonders what Mrs. Kusama makes of all this.
She is hardly to blame.
The machine of digital reproduction is but a wave for us mortals to ride.
If she refused to cooperate, someone else would take her place and the mirror-box would continue to proliferate, long human lines would still form, the pics would still be poasted.
Healthier for sure to surf the wave, make some money for a nice big house, than to be driven mad like poor [jani lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR1xpknCHCQ&t=14s&ab_channel=CrossingTheStreams).

## Death Rattles from the Uncountable Orifices of the Fame Monster

In the land of visual arts, I am a (delighted) foreigner only.
Music is my native medium.
It is easy to understand my friend's distress in a more familiar setting.

I imagine being there to hear a musician performing face-to-face in a cafe.
The same song is changed, changed utterly, when pumped past the blinding stage lights at a mass in which you are a molecule.
It becomes lonely, too, for the artist.
They are blinded by the stage lights, there will always be this thing between them and their audience, the wyrd intermediary, the Fame Monster.
Everyone understands this.
The appeal of, say, Buckley's "phantom solo tour" was obvious for all involved.

There is a horror, even, of blowing up, of a beloved song going [viral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWO4JnP2T40&ab_channel=OurHitParade).
Horror of a tumor become too large, all arteries redirected, no blood left for the man.

It is like having a lover ripped from your embrace, only to be haunted by revenant with his face.
You will never feel each other again, there will be no more communion, but some hyperreal death mask follows you across the many screens and placards.
The image of the revenant is not modern enough, it is not eldritch, it is not hyperdementional beyond human comprehension.
A hydra-headed wight is in the right direction but far too tame.
The Fame Monster has millions of orifices through which issue hauntings.
Eldritch technological haunting multiplexed, broadcast, chopped and screwed.
It has thousands of uncanny replications of fragments, like immortalized cell lines drawn from that cancer which killed him.

## Fuck By Numbers

We live in a paint-by-numbers world.

Dance by numbers, total percentage 96.4572.

Live by number, feeding the follower count until there is no blood left for the woman.

No encounter, only control and copying and the score, living by and for the screen.
Control of and by you until the 'you' is superfluous.
Electron hole in some godforsaken semiconductor!
You aren't even an ant, not even a neuron, you are a linear threshold gate.
You have not three fucking parameters, bitch.

Fuck by numbers!

BREATHE.

We poorly play out this game of digital reproduction.
Matrix multiplication, binary transmission, leave it to computers!
Man and woman are inferior as Xerox machines.
Alas bio-copiers, it would have been better for you had you been made ants.
NO DICK, NO WOMB,(terrified even), only MEMECANCER and FAIL.
Contra the bio-copiers, these poor shambling passionless puppets, life is generative.
Life invades the external and blossoms into it.

What is the score that matters?
A score to sing richly aloud, a partner to thrill, a painting to confront and explore! 
A new land to make one's own, to love.
That is living.

To cast a veil of reverent silence about that quixotic woman grappling with Anselm Kiefer, to clear space for that communion, I would sweep out the door uncountable biocopiers.
In an enlightened future, they also would not be deprived of their fun.
Photos would be generated automatically, of them appearing to look in the direction of appropriately popular paintings, and posted without effort, sparing them the bother of pretending to live.
