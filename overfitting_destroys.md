## Case Study: Structure of Physical Therapy appointments

Effect: Replacement of Care with Appearance of Care

If you don't require a referral for physical therapy, the entire session is partly an extended and continual sales pitch.
It was a bit disorienting the first time I recognized someone I held as a trustworthy authority using the "assumptive close" technique to sign me on cold packs I never asked for and did not need.
Life really is a negotiation.
They were, of course, ethical, and didn't push the cold packs after I told them no.
It got me thinking, though...Why did this PT franchise care enough about cold packs to train their PT assistants in sales techniques?

This could be part of the reason why so many rail against "objectivity" and "Western BioMedicine"\*.
Doctors are ultimately compensated by demonstrating to insurance, through clever manipulation of CPT codes, how much care they are providing for the patient.

We do not live in a wise age but we live in a frighteningly clever one.
That is why the DPT sees you for 15 minutes[CPT 97110], and then moves on to the next patient.
The insurance company has not updated the payout for that code in years.
If you want to get paid properly, you have to also push add-ins like cold packs[CPT 97010] or e-stim[CPT 97014].
I can't believe I never saw this, but now that I have I can't unsee it.

It would take longer than I have to examine how this system evolved, but part of it surely is trust.
Can't trust the doctor to determine the standard of care. They might try to rip somebody off.
Can't trust the patient to evaluate their care. What do they know?
I don't think anyone has ever uttered the sentence "I trust the insurance company", but, implicitly, they are treated as the only trustworthy player in this game.

## More generally:

Bureaucracy is a technology just like a suit of armor or a car.
Skill in it can greatly multiply one's powers, though it may feel unnatural or limit our motion.
But when driven insane by optimization of a single variable, we bend reality and ourselves to fit the machine.
We are like a tree trunk grown against a metal sign.
First, we take its shape, and then it becomes a part of us, like a part of the skeleton.


## wrapup

This kind of bureaucratic gamemanship even distorts our language.
I wonder how much of modern discourse has, as its ultimate goal, maneuvering the adversary into some legally- or socially-actionable category.
The [Noncentral Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yCWPkLi8wJvewPbEp/the-noncentral-fallacy-the-worst-argument-in-the-world) and [Motte and Bailey trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy) are both examples of this, as are slogan such as "(Thing speaker wants) is a HUMAN RIGHT", "(Thing speaker doesn't want) is ABUSE".
That is a topic that deserves a book. I'm sure one has been written, please let me know if you know the title.

There are other forms of bureaucratic failure, such as the social-work graft complex that runs on government slush, idealistic young social workers, and sympathetic patients who the swamp creatures hide behind when someone comes for their ass. Again, books.

Ironically, I think one of the more functional bureaucracies is the DMV. But maybe if I actually talked to someone who knows the system, they'd explain how fucked up it is.
